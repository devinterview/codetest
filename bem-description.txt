BEM structure:

Block - in the main-content template, the article.outer--contacts-container
would be relevant on it's own.

Element - the content of contact-card.html would not make sense alone, it needs
a container which, when styled, will separate the contacts in the list.

Modifier - the class of the section containing the contact details. This describes
the content by it's purpose and its relation to other html.
